### OpenGL graphics program with C#, WinForms and OpenGL

This program was written as part of a final project in a computer graphics course that I have particpicated in during my degree.  
What can this application do?
* Create "game objects" and add them to the scene
* Remove game objects
* Move, rotate and scale game objects.
* Freely move the camera in the scene
* Lock onto an object move around it, zoom in and out of it.
* Easily add a cubemap and apply it to the scene
* Control the light position
* and more...

The main "scene" in the application was built using all the features that were mentioned above to createa a little game with 3 cups and a hidden ball in one of them, the user has to guess where the ball is after the cups have finished swapping rapidly. There are some extra cool effects such as the cups ability to fly with a propeller attatched to the top, shadows being displayed on the table, and a mirror that reflects the scene.

Here's an example:
